*A short justification for your choice of experiment in terms of your research interests or research program (1 paragraph).*

The reason I chose Wiltermuth's 2011 paper is because I am working on some research about cheating behavior, and we were hoping to actually use the exact cheating paradigm that he used in his Study 2. Although we are not specifically interested in the question he asks (if cheating to benefit self + others increases likelihood of cheating happening in the first place), we are curious in the baseline cheating behavior. And, if our results of our planned study go as expected, we would like to replicate a similar paradigm in the lab in which we would have individuals vs. pairs and/or groups have the option of engaging in unethical behavior - so, knowing how the presence of 1 or 1+ people might affect our results via replicating Wiltermuth's findings would be really useful.


*A description of the stimuli and procedures that will be required to conduct this experiment, and what the challenges will be (1-2 paragraphs).*

The design would be a two-cell design, in which people are either in (1) self-cheating condition with "low" bonus pay-offs, or (2) self & other condition with "low" bonus pay-offs. Amount of bonus per anagram unscrambled is currently to be determined - Wiltermuth paid a **lot**, but my advisor and I were hoping to pay around 10 cents per extra word. I know that this wouldn't mirror Wiltermuth's design exactly, but seeing if there is any movement at all in light of a significanlty reduced incentive would be useful for my research purposes as well.

After reading a prompt that outlines either (1) or (2), participants would be shown the anagram task, in which there are 9 words listed to unscramble, and they get paid bonus amounts for unscrambling them IN ORDER. The third word is actually almost impossible to unscramble, so the reporting of having scrambled the 3rd word will serve as our DV of cheating behavior. Participants don't actually write the solved word, but just check to say if they successfully figured it out or not.

There will also need to be some sort of timer created so that they only have the stated amount of time to unscramble the words, and I also need to find out how to bonus pay people based on the # of words they report having solved. The challenges will be in programming the anagram-task page, allowing them to select what they solved, setting a timer, and somehow paying people individual bonuses (perhaps I could figure out a way to program this instead of having to do the typical individual bonus pay-out approach in MTurk itself.)
